I understand that the technical stuff is complex, but as Ari Herstand says, you should spend 50% on your music and 50% promoting it over the entire course of the process. 

And understandingthe promotional bit is essential for any musician. This is the age where tou can make it big with doijg it yourself, so don't be afraid to go out there and learn the ins and outs of the industry. It will only help make you a professional. And that is what you should aim to be. A professional. 

Learn the nitty gritty things, because you're going to be your own Manager, your own PR Agent, your own A&R, your own licensing, your own branding. 

So make sure to get your business plan ready, learn everything you need to, and get your stuff out there!

Now is the greatest time ever for making it in the music industry. And all you need is the necessary skills, patience, and the will to preserve through anything.

I understand that the technical stuff can be complex, but as ***Ari Herstand*** says, you should spend 50% on your music and 50% promoting it; i.e, over the entire course of the process.

And understanding the promotional bit is essential for any musician. This is the age where you can make it big DIY, so don't be afraid to go out there and learn the ins and outs of the industry. Because it is possible to 'Do It Yourself'. It will only help make you a professional if you do. And that is what you should aim to be. A professional.

Learn the nitty gritty, because you're going to be your own **Manager**, your own **PR Agent**, and your own **A&R**.

So make sure to get your business plan ready, learn everything you need to, and get your stuff out there!

I was inspired to write this post because I feel like the only women I see being represented in social media are the big stars like Taylor Swift, Beyonc√©, Katy Perry etc. Although I have nothing against these artists, and acknowledge the fact that they&#44;re talented in their own right, I would still like to see more than just the one-off article on Pitchfork -for example- about the artists I&#44;ve mentioned in the post.
 On the other hand, there are the **WOMEN ONLY** curated playlists you so often find on streaming services like Spotify. The reason I&#44;m not a big fan of them is because of the statement that kind of playlist is making. The statement saying "here&#44;s a playlist you should listen to just because these songs were made by women". And I think that it undermines them in a big way, as these are talented individuals who&#44;ve put in artistic effort to produce excellent, professional records. And I think we should appreciate these women as we would any other artist of any gender, sexuality, and/or religion, i.e, for their art!

Now that I&#44;ve got that out of the way, here is a list of few of the women I&#44;ve come to adore in the music industry, along with a few reasons why:

## Elizabeth Morris
My first encounter with Elizabeth Morris&#44; songwriting was through the final album release of the band [**Allo Darling**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0cygwaJypZFDlu4NLQTm7b) in which she sang, and played the ukulele. I was fortunate enough to have randomly picked up [the LP](https://open.spotify.com/album/1FosDgVaOv7qsZt9k56o1s)  at a local record store, and I fell in love with the record ever since my first listen.

To me, Morris&#44;s writing is honest, innocent, and incredibly relatable. From sappy romantic to contemplative, Morris&#44;s writing is such that it struck a chord with me (pun intended) at every turn, and made me have to take hours off work to ponder about life, to introspect, and to appreciate the people I&#44;ve been fortunate to have in my life. And I always love a record that does that, who doesn&#44;t?

What I admire the most about Elizabeth is the simplicity, not only in her writing, but also in the way she puts chords together on a ukulele. She can make a simple 1-4-1 progression incredibly effective through her sweet melodies, and often touching lyrics.


## Sophie Allison
As a fan of home studios and bedroom production, I was bound to fall in love with Sophie Allison, aka [**Soccer Mommy&#44;s**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4wXchxfTTggLtzkoUhO86Q), music from the very first listen of her latest record [Collection](https://open.spotify.com/album/1NcmOmza86zn7wt02k9q74) (which I highly recommend if you like bedroom pop). Like her [previous album](https://open.spotify.com/album/0WtsLEGmrrEc1TfGeyLi1N), Collection has a raw and minimalistic approach to it, as you can clearly hear in the songs [*"3 AM at a Party"*](https://open.spotify.com/track/05SS1T78bHkLPEb9VTvEoE) and [*"Waiting for Cars"*](https://open.spotify.com/track/4cJjMJ2fMA7edeEI1xbVFO), where it&#44;s mostly just her voice in sung unison with each other and a guitar.

Her music is dynamic, and can be melancholic and energetic at the same time. What I like most about her music is how it flows through so many sections, and how she&#44;s able to transition from one catchy guitar intro, and convert it completely in the pre-chorus and choruses following it.

All in   all, [Allison&#44;s](https://open.spotify.com/track/3B0vMz20sN9UUwAwcP2QGQ) music is a fun combination of good ol&#44; rock song forms, minimal (but effective) use of instrumentation, heavyhearted and personal lyrics, a remarkably unique voice, and a perfect guitar tone!

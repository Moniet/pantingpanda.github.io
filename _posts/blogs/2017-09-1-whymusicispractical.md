Contrary to to popular belief, music has numerous revenue streams which will allow music professionals to earn a respectable living, and they are only growing in number especially with the advents of streaming (Universal Music claims to make 6M in revenues this year).

Here are a few examples of some of the ways to make money in music:

* Music Education
* Music Therapy (a field with an increasing demand)
* Music Journalism
* Music Blogging
* Social Media Management (for the various music studios and entertainment industries)
* Working as an Arranger
* Freelance Composer for Film, Advertising or Video Games
* In house composer for advertising/video game agencies.
* In house and freelance sound designer.
* Public Representative for labels (PR)
* Band Manager
* Music Supervisor

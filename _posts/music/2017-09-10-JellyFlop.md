This project was completed over four months, and was a complete blast for me.
I worked day in and out to get the tracks done, and loved every single minute. The compositions were recorded in the box (aka my bedroom), using industry standard microphones (AT-2050 and SM57), with the evergreen Steinberg 'D-preamp' interface which was also used for percussion samples and electric guitar.

For the SFX, I conducted field recordings for the game and processed them to de-noise, to get a clean sound.
Further, I combined this with audio synthesis to shape the FX in a full rich sound.

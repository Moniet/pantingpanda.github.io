>> Credits: Music Composition for Levels

This theme was a blast to work on! My task was to compose songs for different levels and have them weave into each other seamlessly, which I accomplished thanks to Ableton Live, and its wonderfully easy methods to loop.

Throughout the project, my hands were busy programming the synthesizers.
I chose the synthesizer as it never fails to fit in perfectly with the aesthetics of mobile app games.

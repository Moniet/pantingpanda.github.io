A simple 8-bit game with minimalist chiptune music.

For this project, I designed sounds using virtual synthesizers and included field recordings to set a motif for every level.

For example, I recorded the rustling of bushes, the pitter patter of rain, thunder etc. I believe that this sets the atmosphere for every level and immerses the player even more.

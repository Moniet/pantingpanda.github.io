 On the other hand, there are the <strong>WOMEN ONLY</strong> curated playlists you so often find on streaming services like Spotify. The reason I’m not a big fan of them is because of the statement that kind of playlist is making. The statement saying “here’s a playlist you should listen to just because these songs were made by women”. And I think that it undermines them in a big way, as these are talented individuals who’ve put in artistic effort to produce excellent, professional records. And I think we should appreciate these women as we would any other artist of any gender, sexuality, and/or religion, i.e, for their art!</p>

<p>Now that I’ve got that out of the way, here is a list of few of the women I’ve come to adore in the music industry, along with a few reasons why:</p>

<h2 id="elizabeth-morris">Elizabeth Morris</h2>
<p>My first encounter with Elizabeth Morris’ songwriting was through the final album release of the band <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0cygwaJypZFDlu4NLQTm7b"><strong>Allo Darling’</strong></a> in which she sang, and played the ukulele. I was fortunate enough to have randomly picked up <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1FosDgVaOv7qsZt9k56o1s">the LP</a>  at a local record store, and I fell in love with the record ever since my first listen.</p>

<p>To me, Morris’s writing is honest, innocent, and incredibly relatable. From sappy romantic to contemplative, Morris’s writing is such that it struck a chord with me (pun intended) at every turn, and made me have to take hours off work to ponder about life, to introspect, and to appreciate the people I’ve been fortunate to have in my life. And I always love a record that does that, who doesn’t?</p>

<p>What I admire the most about Elizabeth is the simplicity, not only in her writing, but also in the way she puts chords together on a ukulele. She can make a simple 1-4-1 progression incredibly effective through her sweet melodies, and often touching lyrics.</p>

<h2 id="sophie-allison">Sophie Allison</h2>
<p>As a fan of home studios and bedroom production, I was bound to fall in love with Sophie Allison, aka <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4wXchxfTTggLtzkoUhO86Q"><strong>Soccer Mommy’s</strong></a>, music from the very first listen of her latest record <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1NcmOmza86zn7wt02k9q74">Collection</a> (which I highly recommend if you like bedroom pop). Like her <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0WtsLEGmrrEc1TfGeyLi1N">previous album</a>, Collection has a raw and minimalistic approach to it, as you can clearly hear in the songs <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/05SS1T78bHkLPEb9VTvEoE"><em>“3 AM at a Party”</em></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4cJjMJ2fMA7edeEI1xbVFO"><em>“Waiting for Cars”</em></a>, where it’s mostly just her voice in sung unison with each other and a guitar.</p>

<p>Her music is dynamic, and can be melancholic and energetic at the same time. What I like most about her music is how it flows through so many sections, and how she’s able to transition from one catchy guitar intro, and convert it completely in the pre-chorus and choruses following it.</p>

<p>All in   all, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3B0vMz20sN9UUwAwcP2QGQ">Allison’s</a> music is a fun combination of good ol’ rock song forms, minimal (but effective) use of instrumentation, heavyhearted and personal lyrics, a remarkably unique voice, and a perfect guitar tone!</p>
